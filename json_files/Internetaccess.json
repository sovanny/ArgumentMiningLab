It's not that computers matter more than water, food, shelter and healthcare, but that the network and PCs can be used to ensure that those other things are available. Satellite imagery sent to a local computer can help villages find fresh water, mobile phones can tell farmers the prices at market so they know when to harvest. The same arguments apply in the UK, but those of us who have easy, affordable and fast connectivity tend not to think of the plight of those who can't get online, just as we so often fail to notice the homeless people in our towns or let our eyes glide over deprived housing estates as we sit on the train.", "id": 6}, {"text": "Internet access is not really essential.
