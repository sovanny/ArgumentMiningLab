1 Five years ago this country was on the brink we had millions of people unemployed and we had one of the biggest budget deficits anywhere in the world
2 for the last 5 years we've been working with the British people through a long-term economic plan and that plan is working
3 there are almost 2 million more people in work
4 it's a balance plan so we've invested in our NHS as well as reducing the deficit and we cut taxes for 30 million working people
5 and the plan's working because last year we had the fastest growing economy of any of the major Western countries
6 now tonight you're going to hear a lot of people claiming a lot of things
7 but please remember these are the same people who claimed that if we followed our plan unemployment would go up and that the deficit wouldn't come down the economy wouldn't grow the public services would be destroyed
8 they were wrong then and they are wrong now
9 the choice of this election is sticking with a plan that's working, or going back to the debt, taxes, borrowing and spending that got us in this mess in the first place
10 I say let's not go back to square one Britain can do so much better than that
11 well first of all what I'd say is that we've got a plan which is working: we've taken 3 million of the lowest paid people out of tax and we got almost 2 million people back into work
12 but I think what is absolutely crucial here is recognizing that what our plan involves is balance
13 we're gonna go on investing in the NHS every year as we have done under this government under the last Parliament
14 we're going to do that in the next parliament
15 we're going to find savings of one out of every pounds 100 that the government spends
16 and we need to do that for two more years just as we've done for the last 5 years
17 but the alternative to that plan is actually putting up taxes and I don't want to do that
18 I think that if we go back to the tax, the waste, the spending and the debt, all the things that got us into a mess in the first place, we wouldn't help working people we'd hurt working people, that's what Labour did last time, we mustn't let it happen again
19 Nick is wrong about our plans, because of course we are going to raise 5 billion from tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance as we've done in this Parliament
20 now that's part of the balance plan that also involves putting more money into our NHS
21 here's the point: we've got to understand why the deficit matters and why we got here
22 and the problem with the real choice is with Ed Miliband, who still thinks the last Labour government didn't tax too much, borrow too much, and spend too much and if you don't understand the mistakes of the past, you can't provide the leadership for the future
23 once again he's wrong: just this week we've introduced a diverted-profits tax to go off to these companies that make money in Britain and don't pay tax in Britain
24 but here's what Ed Miliband isn't telling you because he doesn't support any of the spending reductions and efficiencies we've had to make. He wants to make a very big cut. He wants to put up taxes and cut your pay going into your monthly payslip at the end of the month and taking your money out, because he thinks he can spend that money better than you
25 we have cut the deficit in half, we need to clear the rest of it and we'll do that in the coming years, but only if we stick to the plan, and the plan that is working; but it is worth remembering as we debate cuts why did these cuts have to happen, what is the truth about cuts?
26 well I've got the truth about cuts here: this is a copy of the letter that Labour left in the Treasury when we arrived in government 5 years ago and it says I'm sorry we've run out of money
27 that is the truth of what happens when people talk about cuts. We had to make these decisions because the British economy was on the brink, people were worrying about whether we'll be able to pay our debts
28 the brunt of these cuts and the changes we've made, the top 20% have paid more than the remaining 80% put together, that's what happened when Labour were in power and my fear is if they got in power
29 we are going to build 200000 houses for people to buy, we're going to keep on with this reduction in unemployment that sees two million more people in work
30 but you won't do it if we go back to the debt the welfare the spending and the taxes
31 what I would say to Johnny is: we're gonna find pounds 1 out of every 100 that the government spends and save that in each of the next 2 year combined with the extra taxes in terms of tax avoidance and tax evasion, we will eliminate the deficit
32 it's also put more burden on some of the richest people through instance through having a stamp duty on expensive properties
33 but what I'm hearing in this debate is that, whereas I want to save one out of every pounds 100 the government spends to not put up taxes,what I'm hearing is: more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes
34 in the last Parliament, Nicholas, we found pounds 21bn of savings in welfare
35 now what is the alternative to making reductions on welfare? it is putting up taxes
36 well first of all thank you Terry for your incredible service to the NHS, and you're absolutely right, this is the most important national institution and national public service that we have
37 I'll never forget as a dad of a desperately disabled child what I got every night when I took him to hospital worrying about his health
38 I got unbelievable care and I just want that for every family and for everyone in our country
39 now we've been talking about the difficult decisions we had to make to turn the economy around
40 but a difficult decision we made also was to go on funding the NHS, putting more money in every year and we'll go on doing that in the next parliament
41 we've have trained 7000 more nurses, we've got 9000 more doctors, and we also managed to take out of the NHS 20000 bureaucrats because I want the money spent on patient care
42 now it's key that we keep a strong economy in order to fund a strong NHS
43 and I want to see the NHS move to much more seven-day operation like your GP being open 8 in the morning 8 in the evening all the way through the week
44 there is one point I want to end on: there is only one group of politicians anywhere in this United Kingdom that cut the NHS in the last 5 years and that was the Labour Party in Wales
45 so when you hear Ed Miliband's promises think about that
46 what we have seen with cancer under this government is 460000 more people a year getting seen and getting examined for cancer than used to happen
47 our survival rate for cancer that used to be some of the worse in Europe now actually is one of the best in Europe we are changing the NHS and we are improving it
48 but a strong NHS needs a strong economy
49 if we go back to Labour's plans for taxes and debt and spending and welfare the economy will be wrecked, and that will wreck the NHS
50 The commitment we made is important, because when I said we'd fund the NHS more every year the Labour view was that was irresponsible
51 the Liberal Democrat view was that wasn't the right approach and Labour cut the NHS in Wales where the outcomes are worst
52 let me tell Ed Miliband what we did: we took 20000 bureaucrats out of the NHS and put 9000 doctors and 7000 nurses in
53 and he opposes those reforms, presumably he'd like to rehire the bureaucrats. I want doctors with stethoscopes not bureaucrats with clipboards
54 but let me answer Terry very directly about the things we can really do to make a difference with our NHS
55 dementia is a silent crisis in our country we are raising the diagnosing rates we need to keep going with that
56 this point about a seven-day operation is really important. just a few miles down the road from where we are tonight is the Salford Royal Hospital
57 they carry out operations and scans and treatments on Saturday and Sunday as much as they do Monday to Friday and as a result they provide a fantastic service
58 so we can improve our NHS if we improve the way it works and go off to the things like dementia like Public Health and some of the big Public Health challenges that put so much pressure onto our NHS
59 Ed Miliband is scaremongering and he said in an interview that he wanted to weaponize the NHS, now for most of us the NHS is a service for our families, not a political weapon
60 and I think let's be clear about Social Care. We are starting, starting on the 1st of April, a new fund, the Better Care Fund, with pounds 5.3bn in, bringing Health and Social Care together
61 so we can unblock those hospital beds make sure the people get the care they need in the community
62 but Nick was talking about inheritance we had
63 there was something else we inherited in the NHS which was a culture, too often from Labour, of cover up
64 just 60 miles from where we are is the Mid Stafford Hospital, and we all remember what we uncovered with that public enquiry that elderly people were being left uncared for, some of them drinking out of water vials because where weren't looked after, because the target culture had run rampant
65 we have changed that and we've made sure there are more nurses on ward, more doctors in charge, and standards of care going up in our NHS
66 there are more nurses more doctors more people being treated and that's because we have a strong economy
67 he talks about failure let's remember the failure of the last Labour government that virtually bankrupted this country and left us with impossibly difficult decision
68 but the biggest decision we made was to protect the NHS and to spend more every year: a decision that Labour at the time said was irresponsible
69 that's what they said, we ignored that and we went ahead and invested in our NHS as part of a balance plan for our country
70 there's the point about the 5.3bn fund that will help fund those vital social care that Nathan is talking about
71 but I also want to say how important I think it is that we have a seven-day NHS with your GP being open 8 in the morning 8 in the evening 7 days a week because the areas of the country where that's already happening, some of them here in Greater Manchester, were seeing a lot less pressure on hospitals cause people can get to see their GPs when they want
72 all of this is taking the extra resources that we put into the NHS because the long-term economic plan is working
73 oh we do have benefits from immigration as I said in my opening statement but I think the choice really boils down to this Nigel is saying there's nothing you can do inside the European Union so just give up and leave Ed seems to be saying he doesn't want to renegotiate anything in Europe so should just give up altogether I say get stuck in, renegotiate get the changes we need and then put those in a referendum to the British people by the end of 2017
74 I've sat around that table in Europe and negotiated for Britain you can get things done and I've said I want to get done so that we can sort out this immigration issue
75 people said it was impossible, we cut that European budget
76 I said let's get out of these bailout funds where British taxpayers money was being put into countries like Greece, people said you'll never do that, we got out of those Greek bailout funds
77 so instead giving up let's get stuck in and negotiate
78 the problem with Nigel in the end is ultimately Nigel you are just the back door to a Labor government which will give us open-door immigration which is not what this country
79 if we want to control immigration there are three sides to this coin you've got to have an education system that turns out young people that can do the jobs that our economy is creating you have got to have a welfare system that makes sure that work always pays, and we really helped to delivered that over the last few years and you've got to have the immigration changes that I've been talking about
80 it's not simply about what happens in Europe if I think of what we inherited we had bogus colleges that were handing out visas like visa factories, we've shut them down
81 we had people who could claim benefits literally on arrival when Ed Miliband was in the cabinet we've stopped that
82 we had people appealing in our courts against decisions made here, we've now said you have to go home and appeal from home, there are changes you can make
83 we created 2 million jobs because we got a strong and growing economy, when he was sat in the cabinet about half a million people lost their jobs and never mind zero hours, with Ed there'd be zero jobs
84 let me take on Nigel on this, look Nigel, you want to leave the EU it's a very clear position
85 but the only way that can happen is by having a referendum; now I say stay in, fight, get a better deal but hold that referendum
86 the irony of Nigel's position is if people vote for him they end up with Miliband and they get no referendum no renegotiation
87 we have taken some people from Syria some of the most vulnerable people including elderly and disabled people
88 but the most important thing we can do in Syria is maintain the fact that we are one of the biggest, I think the second largest bilateral aid donor, helping people in those refugee camps to be fed, to be housed, to be clothed, and trying to find a solution so they can go home
89 there are about 6 million people refugees or in danger of being refugees we cannot take all those people in so it makes sense to use our aid budget to try and help them in the region [and then help them get home]
90 Thank you Rebecca for your question I think it's absolutely crucial
91 I think the most important thing is to make sure there are good jobs for people to do and honestly in the last Parliament we've created 2 million new jobs and in the next parliament we want to create 2 million more good jobs for people
92 I think apprenticeships and universities are vital. I want our young people have the choice of either, so we're gonna have 3 million apprenticeships in the next parliament
93 but also we've uncapped university places so whoever wants a place can go to university
94 in terms of building homes I want us to build homes that people can afford to buy
95 and that's what our starter homes are all about: put it 80% of the market price, not available to foreign buyers or investment funds, but they're for British people to buy and to own
96 and with our help to buy, that has helped about 88000 people onto the housing ladder, we can make that a reality for people
97 now I know it seems odd to answer a question from a young person about pensions
98 but actually it is important to be able to look forward to security and dignity in old age and we've safeguarded the pension because people in our country should be able to look forward to dignity and security
99 but let me make a point about schools because actually under this government we got a million more children in good or outstanding schools
100 one of the reasons for that is that we've opened up the state education system and encouraged great education providers teachers and charities to come in and set up schools
101 I was at one today, the Warrington King's Academy, 3 times more people want to go than they can take
102 and I think these free schools are a great institution but Ed Miliband's party says no more and is even contemplating shutting down some of the schools that are about to get going
103 I say we need more good school places and whether they are Academies or free schools or Universities
104 you know with Nick Clegg we sat in the Cabinet Room together we took difficult decisions together and Nick I, like, defend all of the decisions we took
105 I mean, that is the truth and young people suffer the most, when you have an economy with out-of-control debt, out-of-control welfare, out-of-control spending, young people suffer the most
106 well I think there obviously has been a very difficult time, recovering from the appalling recession that we had it has been tough it has been difficult
107 but Britain has still got some great strengths, we got a strong and growing economy we're creating jobs we're part of all these important networks in the world whether it's the G8, or NATO, or the European Union
108 we have clout in the world, we can get things done in the world
109 think of what some of our people are doing right now: we got nurses in West Africa helping to deal with ebola we got some of those brave and professional Armed services anywhere in the world and tonight's a good moment to say thank you to them for all they do
110 the lady makes an important point, which is: there are people who come out of our armed services who do have difficulties, and that's why we should be putting money into the armed forces charities that help homeless people and people also with mental health problems [when they come out of our armed service]
111 I mean I think Leanne makes a good point: we discovered today there about 70 Labour MPs that employ people on zero-hours contracts and so they obviously haven't got the bit about practising where they preach
112 but there is a big point here: yesterday a hundred of business leaders from some of the most iconic business brands, large and small, said that the plan that we have is getting the country back to work, is getting the country on the right track
113 and if we go off with that with Ed Miliband's plan we put the country at risk the recovery at risk and jobs at risk
114 I have been your Prime Minister for the last 5 years and all that time I've tried to have one task in mind above all others, and that has been: turning our economy around putting the country back to work and clearing up the mess that was left to us
115 I want to stand for another 5 years because I want us to finish the job that we've all started
116 we've created 2 million jobs let's create a job for everyone who wants and needs one
117 we cut the deficit in half let's clear it altogether and have Britain back in the black
118 we've invested in our National Health Service let's keep doing that and make sure it's a genuine service seven days a week for you and your family all year around
119 what my plan is about is basically one word: security. security for you, for you family, for our country
120 this is an amazing country and we're on our way back
121 and there's a fundamental choice of this election: stick with the plan with a team who brought that plan because it's working and it's helping, or put it all at risk by the people who gave us the spending the debt the taxes and the waste
122 I say let's stick to the plan that's working, let's not go back to square one, let's finish what we started
