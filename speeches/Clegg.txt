1 I think it's pretty obvious that no one standing here is going to win this election outright so you're gonna have to choose like you did last time who's gonna have to work with whom
2 and look, I'm not gonna pretend that everything's perfect, though the country's in a lot better shape now than it was 5 years ago
3 I'm not even gonna pretend that I haven't made mistakes: I have, I've put my hands up when I have, and I've learned from them
4 but what you will get from me and from the Liberal Democrats is this: the grit and the resilience to finish the job of balancing the books and doing so fairly
5 I will always act responsibly, I'll never let anyone else borrow money that we don't have and jeopardize your risk your jobs and our economy
6 and above all, I will always act fairly
7 I won't let anyone else impose ideological cuts on your hospitals in your school
8 and I will always serve the whole of our country, not just parts of our country: the whole of our wonderful United Kingdom
9 Johnny, I think it's all about balance, isn't it?
10 that's why I don't think that you should be faced, Johnny, with the stark choice of either cutting too much George Osborne and David Cameron's plan is for pounds 50bn of cuts: way beyond those needed or borrowing too much, which is Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's plan: they want to borrow pounds 70 bn more than is necessary
11 I think it's a dismal choice, cutting too much or borrowing too much
12 it's a balance, and it does mean, yes, you need to reduce spending but you also need to make those with the broader shoulders, the wealthiest, to pay a bit more through the tax system to balance the books
13 that's the way you can balance the books, do it fairly, also then of course put money into public services, perhaps most especially the NHS which does need more money because of the fact we've got an ageing population
14 so the Liberal Democrat plan is a very simple one: we'll cut less than the Conservatives, and we'll borrow less than Labour
15 I have a question for David Cameron, because he's just said to all of us that he wants to stay the course
16 because that's not what the Conservative Party wants to do at all
17 remarkably, the Conservative Party have said they're not gonna ask the richest in society to make a single extra penny of contribution to balancing the books through the tax system
18 they want to impose ideologically driven cuts on schools
19 so I'd like you know I just when I hear the Conservatives talk about that choice between competence and chaos, just imagine, David Cameron the chaos in people's lives, the people who in the NHS don't know whether you're gonna find the money, why people who don't know whether their nursery or their college of their schools are going to close
20 that's why Johnny's right, you need to take a balanced approach
21 you do need to reduce spending but you also need to ask the richest to make a contribution, it's the only fair way of finishing
22 well I don't actually think making the poorest on this side of the planet poorer still is necessarily the best solution to our problems
23 but look, it comes back to a simple issue: how do you balance the books but do it fairly
24 I don't believe, unlike David Cameron and George Osborne, we should do it by just letting the very richest off scot free
25 their plans don't involve a single extra contributions to the tax system
26 I don't equally think it is fair to do what the Labour Party wants to do, which is actually to increase borrowing: that doesn't help the future generations
27 David Cameron make much further cuts than is needed because they want to
28 look, we've heard lots of warm words here about the NHS, of course we all love the NHS, but the NHS doesn't need warm words, it needs hard cash
29 and I'll give you the precise number of how much extra cash it needs: it needs pounds 8 bn by the end of the next Parliament that is what a man called Simon Stevens, who runs NHS England, is independent of politics, has said it needs.
30 now, the Liberal Democrats have a plan about how to find that pounds 8 bn
31 unlike the Conservatives, we'll ask the richest to pay a little extra in tax for the NHS, closing the reliefs for instance in capital gains tax
32 unlike the Labour, we'll also be able to put money in the NHS, cause we'll actually get the job done of balancing the books and then we can invest in the NHS
33 that is the way to balance the books and invest in the NHS
34 this means pounds 8 bn more here, pounds 800 million more for the NHS in Scotland, and pounds 450 million more in Wales
35 and I'll challenge the leaders here: if you love the NHS so much, why don't you put your money where your heart is
36 may I just I mean Terry asked how you're gonna safeguard the NHS for future generations
37 and in view of this, Terry and I, we all know of our ageing population. The NHS is under greater pressure than is have been ever before
38 but it was a simple question who has got the plan to put pounds 8bn of additional money into the NHS
39 that's what all of us standing here have been told it requires
40 you're not gonna get it in Scotland, the SNP have actually reduced the amount of money compared to what we've done in south of the border
41 and you're only gonna get it if you're going to ask the wealthiest to pay a small additional contribution
42 one other thing I'd like to say: mental health's for far too long been the poor cousin of physical health in the NHS
43 the more we can do to treat mental health in the same way that we've long treated physical health I think that will put NHS in good shape the future
44 well look it is just simply not the case, is just simply not true that there's been some great push towards privatisation, it is simply not the case
45 we legislated to outlaw the sweetheart deals which were entered into it with the private sector by the Labour government, as it happened
46 when we took over 5 years ago the total amount of NHS money devoted to the private sector was 4%, it is now 6%
47 I don't call that the great sweeping act of privatization
48 but all I would say is: it needs the money, 8bn, we need to prioritize mental health and we need to bring social care and health care together
49 cause we have too many elderly folk in hospital beds who should be discharged from hospital but don't have a place to go
50 was I saying 5 years ago we inherited a situation where the previous Labour government had wasted pounds 250 million, can't deny this Ed Miliband, on sweetheart deals with private-sector contractors near NHS, which didn't help a single NHS patient
51 we outlawed that use of public money for private-sector contracts which are only based on price rather than quality
52 as I said earlier 4% under Labour was already devoted to the private sector
53 I would suggest in this discussion we need three things to safeguard the NHS, which was Terry's original question first: money, pounds 8bn, my party has a plan to do so. secondly: give mental health the same importance and emphasis in the NHS as traditionally given to physical health and thirdly: make sure that when people, particularly elderly patients, are discharged from hospital, the social care system has a place for them to go
54 oh I will never spread fear about immigration because I think we should remember this, there's basically good immigration and bad immigration
55 and John in a bad immigration of course that needs to be stopped. That's why we've introduced new checks at the borders to bear down on illegal immigration, why we've increased the penalties against unscrupulous employers who employ people and exploit them from elsewhere, why people now who want to seek benefits have to learn English.
56 But there is also good immigration: we should remain a decent generous-hearted open-minded nation who welcomes people who want to come here play by the rules pay their taxes create jobs help in the NHS
57 If we turn everybody away, the NHS will collapse overnight
58 so I guess my approach to immigration could be summarised simply as this: that I want Britain to be open for business but not open to abuse
59 I think as far as immigration in the European Union is considered, firstly I'd say the freedom to move around the European Union should never be the same as the freedom to claim freedom to claim benefits on the first day you arrived no questions asking, get to split those two things off and that's something that we have done
60 secondly, it is a two-way street: there are almost as many Brits living elsewhere and living and working elsewhere in the European Union European than there are Europeans working here
61 and finally, if you want to make sure that our own youngsters get the jobs that other people from elsewhere in Europe might wanna get, you got to train them up, and one of the things I'm most proud of over the last 5 years is that we've now got 2 million people starting new apprenticeships: the biggest increase in apprenticeships since the last war and by the way over half of those are women starting apprenticeships so train up our own youngsters so that they get the jobs which they apply for here at home
62 well I think the answer to that is to raise the minimum wage, which we are now doing so faster than we've ever done before, train up new apprenticeships, which we've done on a scale we never have done before
63 but Nigel Farge talks about remember history, I mean, the Farage family were foreigners
64 the freedom to move around the European Union should not be the same as the freedom to claim
65 your problem is you seem to imply anyone who's foreigner who comes to this country is a menace
66 Nigel Farage seems to think that every single problem in the world could be solved by a referendum on Europe
67 because at the end of the day Europe isn't perfect, of course it's not perfect
68 but it is the world's largest marketplace of 500 million shoppers who buy our goods and buy our services
69 so if you do what Nigel Farage or a significant part of the Conservative Party want, which is to yank ourselves out of the family of Nations that makes up the European Union, unemployment will go up
70 I would never ever ever endorse an approach which would make our country poorer and would see more people out of work, I think it is deeply irresponsible
71 I strongly agree that apprentiships, which is an old idea, that idea that you sort of earn and learn, that you know you learn the tricks of the trade while you're actually working on the shop floor in the office or elsewhere is a great old idea that which we have given it new life
72 we got 2 million new apprenticeships created over the course of this last parliament, it's never been expanded on such a scale
73 and I think it's something that I hope all future parliaments will continue with, because it's a fantastic way to allow our youngsters to get their first
74 Rebecca let me take the issue of tuition fees head on, I've caused famously, infamously, I couldn't put into practice my party's policy on tuition fees for reasons which, I hope, you're familiar with, they were introduced by Labour and actually checked up by Labour, and there was no money left
75 but, we did the next best thing, got the fairest deal possible and thankfully now there're more young people going to university than ever before more on full time courses and there are more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds
76 but if I couldn't do that I hope some fair minded folk would at least acknowledge many of the other things I'm very proud I have managed to do: to give more opportunities, to create a stronger economy, and a fairer society
77 we've talked about more apprenticeships than ever before a huge tax cuts, which mean you pay nothing, no tax, on the first pounds 10600 you earn, as of next week a better money going to schools for the pupil premiumed for disadvantaged kids healthy meals at lunch time for little children at primary school these are the things which make a fairer future for future generations, and I'm very very proud of them
78 why is the Conservative party planning to cut the money for schools?
79 you're planning to cut over pounds 3bn out of the schools budget
80 that is no way to guarantee fairness
81 I remember vividly, when your party wanted to cut spending for the schools at the beginning of last parliament and I said no
82 cause you don't make society fairer by cutting the money that go to nurseries, colleges and schools
83 you know, I got this sort of pious stance from Ed Miliband
84 this is the man who is part of the government that said no boom-and-bust in the economy, and crashed our economy, jeopardizing the future generations and life chances of millions of people this country
85 I have apologized, I've taken responsibility for the mistakes I've made,
86 why don't you, in front of the British people, Ed Miliband, apologize say I'm sorry for crushing the British economy
87 on the housing point, is a very important point, cause Rebecca I'm sure is in keeping with lots and lots of young people worried, that you're not gonna be able to get your feet on the first rung of the property ladder
88 the Liberal Democrats we got I think an idea which I hope will help Rebecca and it is this:
89 at the moment lots and lots of young people can't afford the deposit to get a mortgage on a property
90 so what we would do is to introduce a rent-to-own scheme where you wouldn't need to find a deposit to buy a house, but every time you pay your rent at market rates you'd build up a share of ownership in your home so by renting you become over time an owner in your home
91 I think that would be a great great way, which can introduce in the next Parliament, to give people like Rebecca the tangible belief that they can hope to live in a home which they can call their own
92 the only way we're going to instill optimism is if you wipe the slite slate clean for the next generation
93 we have to release Rebecca and her generation of the debt and the deficit of this generation
94 I don't want Rebecca, I don't want my own kids I don't want any of our children to pay the price for this generation's mistake
95 and if I can leave Rebecca and everybody with just one figure in mind, one statistic pounds 46bn: that is what we as a country will spend next year just paying off the interest on our debts
96 just imagine the number the hundreds of thousands of homes we could build for pounds 46bn
97 pounds 46bn is the same as pounds 700 for every man woman or child in this country
98 and that is why I when I hear some leaders implying that we shouldn't somehow get rid of our deficit, I say look, if you don't do that, it's a bit like Miriam and me said, we're not going to pay off our credit card bill and we'll get our little kids to pay for us
99 well thank you for sitting through this 2 hour political marathon
100 and I just have one more thing to ask of you and it is this: when you vote make sure that you decide what's right for you and your family, make sure that you do what's right for our country
101 but above all make sure that we don't lurch this way or that, make sure that we don't borrow too much on the one hand or we cut too much on the other
102 in other words, make sure that when you vote we keep our country stable and strong and fair
103 and the only way we can do that is by finishing the job, finishing it fairly, balancing the books, doing it fairly, and putting money into our public services
104 because that's the only way that we can create the society that I imagine we all want: a society where we have a stronger economy, and a fairer society where there is opportunity for everyone
