1 Here's what I believe: Britain succeeds when working people succeed. But that's not the way it's been over the last five years.
2 For five years, wages haven't kept up with bills.
3 For five years, the NHS has been going backwards.
4 For five years, our young people have been fearing of having a worse life than their parents.
5 It doesn't have to be this way.
6 If I'm Prime Minister, I'll raise the minimum wage to pounds 8 an hour, and ban exploitative zero-hours contracts so I'll reward hard work again in our country.
7 If I'm Prime Minister, I'll rescue our NHS, hiring more doctors and nurses.
8 if I'm Prime Minister, I'll build a future for all of our young people, saying to our young people: "If you get the grades get an apprenticeship," and cutting the tuition fees from pounds 9000 to pounds 6000
9 I will cut the deficit every year and balance the books.
10 Some people'll tell you tonight: "This is as good as it gets for Britain."
11 I say: "Britain could do so much better than it's done over the last 5 years."
12 Johnny, we'll cut the deficit every year and as I said in the opening we will balance the books, but we'll do it in a fairer and better way than it's been tried over the last 5 years.
13 David Cameron promised to eliminate the deficit and he failed
14 So what we'll do is, first of all we'll have fair taxes, so we'll reverse the tax cut that he gave to millionaires, pounds 43000 to every millionaire in Britain;
15 secondly we will have common sense spending reductions, so outside key areas like education and health spending will fall;
16 but thirdly we'll do something else:
17 because your living standards have fallen over the past five years, and it hasn't just been bad for working people,
18 it's also meant the government hasn't had the tax revenues coming in, that's why this government failed on the deficit.
19 So what we'll do is by boosting living standards, that's the third part of a plan, to live within our means, get the deficit down and balance the books
20 It's a fair way, it's a better way, for our country.
21 I think not the first time tonight David Cameron hasn't wanted to talk about the past but he doesn't want to talk about the future
22 but David you just said that you were tackling tax avoidance
23 Let's look at the reality on this: you haven't acted on the tax havens, you haven't acted on the hedge funds,
24 will you show how you can raise over pounds 1 billion as well as about pounds 2.5bn Time to Care Fund for the NHS
25 it'll hire 20000 more nurses, 8000 more doctors, 5000 more careworkers, and 3000 more midwives
26 now, you have to ask yourself at home, why won't David Cameron act on those hedge funds? they fund his party
27 You're gonna hear all the scaremongering tonight, from Nick Clegg and from David Cameron
28 that's because they're scared that you're gonna kick them out
29 ah now look: I think is a big decision for our country
30 David Cameron wants to double the cuts in spending next year
31 at home you've got to make a decision: is that really a balanced plan?
32 I think that would put at risk the NHS which is gone backwards under David Cameron
33 I think it's much better to have a fair plan which says those with the broader shoulders should bear the greatest burden, and we will make reductions in spending
34 there you go again! you can't talk about the present, and you can't talk about the future, so you'd want to talk about the past
35 I think people at home will want to know what do we gonna do for them in the next 5 years, not talking about the past
36 you backed our spending plans until 2008 it so happens
37 but let's talk about the future, let's talk about the choices for working families in the future
38 how are we gonna have fairer taxes, so those with the broader shoulders bear the greatest burden?
39 are we gonna have common sense reductions in spending?
40 no I don't Leanne, and let me tell you about the differences between me and David Cameron as you've raised this point and it is an important point
41 he refuses to have a mansion tax on the most expensive homes, about pounds 2 million, to fund the NHS, and instead he chooses to keep the bedroom tax
42 I'll have a mansion tax, I'll also have a bankers bonus tax put our young people back to work
43 I will make fair choices, much fairer choices than him
44 and he wants to go much further on the deficit, he wants to go much further on spending cuts
45 and that will mean not just that we balance the books but go further, and that will mean a crushing impact on public service
46 two weeks ago we had a vote against Torial austerity
47 I do think we've seen the choice tonight Jillie because, I said I'll cut the deficit every year and we'll balance the books
48 I said there'll have to be spending reductions outside key areas like the NHS and education
49 David Cameron has an extreme plan, he's failed in his plan and wants to go much much further
50 I'm not gonna stand on the stage tonight and don't say they don't need to be difficult decisions
51 cuts will have to come, but we can do it in a balanced way, we can do it in a fair way
52 Terry, like so many people around the country I'm deeply concerned about what I see happening in our National Health Service because we see people waiting longer for their test results, longer in A&E, longer to see a GP, longer to have an operation. We've got to turn it round
53 and when you hear from us leaders tonight I think at home you should ask: Where specifically is the money coming from?
54 I'll tell you: we're gonna have a mansion tax on the most expensive homes, about pounds 2 million, and that's a clear promise from us
55 we're going to get money from those hedge funds who're engaging in tax avoidance, and we're gonna get money from the tobacco companies, for a pounds 2.5bn Time to Care Fund
56 that will hire 20000 more nurses, 8000 more doctors, 5000 more careworkers, and 3000 more midwives
57 and it's not just more staff, because it's also joining up services from home to hospital, taking on the biggest challenge our NHS faces, which is an aging population cause if people can't get in to see the GP or can't be looked after at home, they end up in A&E, it's a plan to turn the NHS around
58 Nigel, of course we have to look at those issues and deal with them, but I really don't believe that that is at the root of all the problems of the National Health Service
59 and I don't want to pick up on something David Cameron said, but he said he'd protected the NHS
60 I'll ask you at home to decide whether this is what protection looks like
61 a million people waited last year in A&E for more than 4 hours
62 we've got ambulances queuing outside our Accident & Emergency units
63 we're missing the targets for cancer treatment for the first time ever
64 and to add to that, we had a tent, a tent erected in the hospital car park to treat people in 2015 in our United Kingdom
65 I do not believe that is protecting the NHS, and his spending plans for the next parliament are even more dangerous for our National Health Service
66 I'll just say on this Leanne, my two sons were born in a PFI hospital, and it was an old, falling down hospital
67 but you're right, there need to be limits to privatization
68 that's why we said we'll roll back the tide of privatisation that is starting under David Cameron, and is about to go much much further
69 we'll cut the profits of the private sector
70 he said he's protected the NHS and he said he kept his word
71 David you made a whole series of promises at the last general election to people
72 you said no top down reorganization, you didn't listen to the staff, and that's exactly what happened
73 you said no going back to the days when people had to wait hours on end in A&E and that's exactly what happened
74 I don't think people will take seriously your promises on the NHS, because you broke all the promises you made at the last general elections
75 you supported the Health and Social Care Act, which is the recipe for privatisation of our NHS
76 but there's a bigger issue for people at home, and that's future plans for the NHS
77 I've set out where the money's coming from
78 David Cameron is planning to double the spending cuts next year, and bigger cuts in the next 3 years
79 think what that would mean not just for the NHS, but social care
80 if you cut social care dramatically, as has happened in this Parliament, you undermine the NHS fundamentally because elderly people don't get the help in their own home, they end up in hospital, and the NHS is creaking at the seams
81 that is what is happening now, imagine what it would be like with another five years of David Cameron
82 well look, I would say to everybody at home that: use your vote in this election as a weapon to fight for the future of our National Health Service
83 I've got to say, over 13 years our Labor government transformed the NHS from 18 month waiting to 18 week waiting
84 that's our record, and now it's going backwards on your watch.
85 you failed the British people, you've broken your bond of trust on the National Health System. They believed you, they believed you
86 look, people at home'll have to decide. I think the NHS is the foundation for working families in our country
87 that's why my plan says: only when working people succeed that Britain succeed
88 David Cameron wants to tell you it's all got a lot better, he wants to congratulate himself, patting himself on the back, saying he's done a great job
89 you've got to decide about what your experiences and what you see in the NHS
90 John thank you for your question
91 I changed Labour's approach on immigration because I don't think it's prejudiced to worry about immigration
92 I think people's concerns are real and they've got to be dealt with, and I want to explain how we'll deal with them
93 if I'm elected as Prime Minister we'll put in place new rules which say that if you come to this country you won't get benefits for at least the first two years
94 I will also do something else, which I think is of concern to many people in our country we'll stop the undercutting of wages and conditions that happens so often
95 employers exploiting migrant labour not paying the minimum wage recruiting only from abroad to undercut wages
96 there've been just two prosecutions for failure to pay the minimum wage in the last 5 years: we've got to deal with it, and if I'm prime minister, I will
97 there's one other thing I'll say to you there: if you want a party that will cut Britain off from the rest of the world, that's not me
98 I believe we've got to play our role in the world, but if you want to party with controls on immigration, that's what I offer
99 David, I'm wondering what world do you live in
100 you talked about your negotiating skill in Europe. You made a big stand against the President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker
101 you lost by 26 votes to 2, because you had no allies
102 and the problem is: David Cameron has marginalized us in Europe
103 now, I just want to be honest with people at home
104 there're false promises you get from David Cameron, he stood on this stage 5 years ago and set net migration into the tens of thousands, and yet he said: "Kick me out!" if I fail to deliver-well, I suggest you do but he failed on that promise, and he's gonna make that promise again and there's false solutions from Nigel Farage. I'm just gonna be frank with people: I don't think our place lies outside of the European Union
105 I think that'll be a disaster for jobs, I think that'll be a disaster for families and businesses
106 let's change Europe so it works better for us including on immigration, but let's not sacrifice jobs businesses and families
107 David Cameron said earlier that work pays in our country: Rubbish! Work doesn't pay in our country!
108 there are so many people around our country, millions of people, people watching at home tonight, who are going out doing all the hours that God sends, and who can't feed their family, can't make ends meet at the end of the month
109 and let's take the issue of zero-hours contracts, because it's relevant to this debate
110 if work is insecure, if work doesn't pay properly, then you don't get the security that working people need
111 now I say we should deal with those exploitative zero-hours contacts. It's an absolutely crucial part of this immigration debate
112 because you've got to create security for the working families of Britain, and that's what I will do
113 my priority as a Prime Minister is to tackle the cost of living crisis, sort our NHS, and build a future for our young people
114 and look, you know, the British people have a decision to make tonight, and at the general election
115 David Cameron will spend the next 2 years deciding whether to exit the European Union, something he doesn't even want to do: he says he wants to stay in the European Union!
116 so look, I say, there's better priorities for our country and they'll be my priorities as a Prime Minister
117 well we did get it wrong, and I've said we got it wrong, and I've changed our approach
118 but I do think there's a wider issue here about the opportunity for our young people. Nick and David were saying how brilliant everything is on apprenticeships
119 take an issue: IT
120 we import lot we bring lots of people into this country, who are contributing to our country from other countries, with special skills in IT
121 but apprenticeships in IT are actually falling in our country
122 well the answer is: we should say that if you want to bring in a skilled worker from outside the European Union you must provide apprenticeships to the next generation
123 because homegrown opportunity is an essential part of dealing with people's concerns
124 Rebecca, you speak for so many young people right across our country so many young people I meet, who are asking why they're paying the price of hard times
125 and that's what we've got to turn round, and that's what I'm going to do if I'm your Prime Minister
126 look, the first thing we've got to do is we've got to guarantee all young people access to good education so you get a high-quality apprenticeship if you get the grades, that's a guarantee the next Labour government will make and also cut the tuition fee from pounds 9000 to pounds 6000 because I don't want our young people drowning in debt when they leave University
127 next we've got to create good jobs for young people, that's why I will ban the exploitation of zero-hours contracts
128 I will say: if you do regular hours, you get a regular contract
129 and lastly we'll build homes again in our country
130 200000 homes a year by 2020 and get a fair deal for young people in the private rented sector where many young people are being ripped off
131 I believe in what I call the promise of Britain: that the next generation does better than the last. I believe we can restore it
132 I think I would say to David Cameron is of course his scares about free school are wrong
133 we do not want a system in the future which has unqualified teachers, 17000 unqualified teachers in our schools
134 but there is a bigger issue because Rebecca who asks the questions was about asking about young people going into the world today
135 and you've heard David Cameron and Nick Clegg defend a system which ensures that young people leave University with pounds 44000 with a debt
136 he didn't have to leave school with pounds 44000 with a debt, nor did he, now nor did I
137 but the difference with me is: I'm gonna do something about it. I'm gonna cut the tuition fee. Would I like to go further than pounds 6000? Of course I would
138 but is a costed plan to reduce the tuition fee
139 and Nick, you're describing a broken promise as the next best thing-and I'm gonna try and remember that for the future-but you know, it was a broken promise
140 and let me just point this out: David, when you were in opposition at the time, as leader of the opposition you were saying the banks were overregulated, so I'm really not gonna take any lectures from you about the global financial crisis
141 I want to pick up on something that's very important to young people, which is: renting in the private sector
142 lots of young people have this experience, it's incredibly insecure, it's sometimes substandard accommodation
143 and we're the only party with a plan to get a fair deal in the private rented sector 3-year tenancies, not one-year tenancies, rent stabilized during that time, and stopping letting agents charging tenants, because at the moment they charge tenants and landlords fees
144 and that is a massive issue for young people all across our country and we will act
145 but is all part of saying, look, we've got to stand up somebody's powerful interests and actually make this country work for young people
146 I shall be very practical about this. What's one of the most important things for our young people? the quality of jobs.
147 we'got 700000 people in our country on zero-hours contracts, probably some people watching tonight at home, waiting for that text message to say whether you have work tomorrow
148 and David Cameron says he couldn't live on a zero-hours contract. Well nor could I David.
149 but the difference with me is I'm going to do something about it. I'm gonna legislate, so if you do regular hours you get a regular contract not a zero-hours contract
150 and it goes to what kind of country we build: do we build a country with security for working families and for our young people?
151 there is a big choice in this general election: he thinks that as long as a few corporations and individuals do well, the richest and most powerful, the wealth would trickle down to everyone else
152 well, he would try that experiment over the last 5 years
153 you've heard from 7 leaders tonight, but there's one fundamental choice at this election do we build a Britain that puts working people first, or do we carry on with a government that is not on your side?
154 if I'm Prime Minister I'll make sure we'll reward the hard work of everybody in our country, not just those who get the six-figure bonuses
155 if I'm Prime Minister I'll take on those energy companies that are ripping you off
156 if I'm Prime Minister everyone will play by the same rules. We won't give the green light to tax avoidance
157 and if I'm Prime Minister we'll cut the deficit every year, balance the books, but will protect health and education
158 there is a big choice at this election
159 I believe that it is when working people succeed that Britain succeed
160 if you believe that too, I ask for your support, and let's bring the change that Britain needs
